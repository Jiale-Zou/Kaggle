### Codes for kaggle competition 'Predicting Loan Payback' ###

The file named 'utils.py' contains some utility classes,
and file named 'explore.ipynb' contains steps of data exploration.
Subdirectory 'model' contains the paramameters of models.
The other 'ipynb' files are several models for this competition.


1. 'scale_weight.ipynb':
Using cost-sensitive learning to deal with sample unbalanced.

2. 'resample.ipynb':
Using upsampleing on minority label to deal with sample unbalanced.

3. 'multi_machine.ipynb'
Using data splitting and bagging methodology to deal with sample unbalanced.

4. 'multi_machine_balanced.ipynb'
The only difference between 'multi_machine.ipynb' and 'multi_machine_balanced.ipynb' is that the preprocessing method on valid dataset dan test dataset.
